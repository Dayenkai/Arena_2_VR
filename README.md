# Arena_2_VR
Arena VR is a Vr boxing game implemented via Unreal Engine 4. In a context of the creation of school projects, my friends Guillaume Teak, Risan Kamalakaran, KÃ¶se Berkant, Fokam Ollivier and myself dived into the development of it,
discovering the assets and the tools of this powerful engine. The rules are those of a classic boxing game, 
except that the game is still in progress, this version just ensure player movements and blows combinations,
IA pathfindings, collision boxes, animations and a bit of environmental details.
